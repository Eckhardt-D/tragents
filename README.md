## Tragents

Explorations in generating pseudo-random fake stock/currency etc. market data
and using it to feed trading agents with biases to see how they perform.

### Disclaimer

This is a toy project, nothing in here represents real or accurate market data.
The agents will most probably fail in real markets. *Do not use this for trading.*

I literally just am building it to learn about the Zig programming language and
to have fun.

> It was fascinating to see how random OHLC data can look like actual charts when rendered.
